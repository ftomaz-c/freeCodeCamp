## Welcome to my Responsive Web Design Portfolio! 🚀

In this repository I'll showcase my journey in building webpages that can adapt  across various devices and screen sizes. It is an attempt of learn more about HTML and CSS for web development.

This course is divided in 5 parts and at the end of each part there is a related project. These projects are required to get the certification.

These projects were completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

### What I've done so far:

🌐 **A Cat Photo App** - to learn the most common HTML;

🍰 **A Cafe Menu** - to learn CSS by designing a webpage;

🎨 **A set of colored markers** - to learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other;

📋 **A registration Form** - to learn HTML forms by building a sign-up page and some new CSS tools for styling a page.

### Certification Projects

Here are the Certification Projects (1 of 5 done):

* [Survey Form](https://github.com/ftomaz-c/freeCodeCamp/tree/main/Responsive%20Web%20Design/Certification%20project) - to collect data from users; ✔️
* Tribute Page;
* Technical Documentation Page;
* Product Landing Page;
* Personal Portfolio Webpage.

I'll showcase here the 5 projects for this course!

Thank you.

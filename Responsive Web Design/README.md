## Welcome to my Responsive Web Design Portfolio! 🚀

In this repository I'll showcase my journey in building webpages. It is an attempt to learn more about HTML and CSS for web development.

This course is divided in 5 parts. At the end of each part there is a related project. These projects are required to get the certification.


### What I've done so far:

🌐 **A Cat Photo App** - to learn the most common HTML tags;

🍰 **A Cafe Menu** - to learn CSS by designing a webpage;

🎨 **A set of colored markers** - to learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other;

📋 **A registration Form** - to learn HTML forms by building a sign-up page and some new CSS tools for styling a page.

### Certification Projects

Here are the Certification Projects (1 of 5 done):

* [Survey Form](https://github.com/ftomaz-c/freeCodeCamp/tree/main/Responsive%20Web%20Design/1.certification%20project) - to collect data from users; ✔️
* Tribute Page;
* Technical Documentation Page;
* Product Landing Page;
* Personal Portfolio Webpage.
